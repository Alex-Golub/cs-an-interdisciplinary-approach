/**
 * 3. Maximum square submatrix.
 * Given an n-by-n matrix of 0s and 1s, find a contiguous square submatrix of maximum size that contains only 1s.
 * The maximum square submatrix problem is related to problems that arise in databases,
 * image processing, and maximum likelihood estimation.
 * It is also a popular technical job interview question.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * Size. The size of a square submatrix is its number of rows (or columns).
 *       You may assume that argument to the size() method is a square matrix containing only 0s and 1s.
 *
 * Contiguous. The square submatrix must be contiguousâ€”the row indicies must be consecutive
 *             and the column indices must be consecutive.
 *
 * Performance. The size() method should take time proportional to n^2 in the worst case !!!
 *
 * Input format. Standard input will contain a positive integer n, followed by n lines,
 *               with each line containing n 0s and 1s, separated by whitespace.
