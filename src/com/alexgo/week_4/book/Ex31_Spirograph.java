/**
 * 1.5.31 Spirographs.
 * Write a program that takes three double command-line arguments R, r, and a and draws the resulting spirograph.
 * A spirograph (technically, an epicycloid) is a curve formed by rolling a circle of radius r around a larger fixed
 * circle of radius R.
 * If the pen offset from the center of the rolling circle is (r + a), then
 * the equation of the resulting curve at time t is given by
 * x(t) = (R + r ) cos(t) - (r + a ) cos((R + r )t /r)
 * y(t) = (R + r ) sin(t) - (r + a ) sin((R + r )t /r)
 * Such curves were popularized by a best-selling toy that contains discs with gear
 * teeth on the edges and small holes that you could put a pen in to trace spirographs.
