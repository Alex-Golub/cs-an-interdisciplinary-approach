1.5.9 Suppose that the file input.txt contains the two strings F and F.
What does the following command do (see exercise 1.2.35)?
  % java Dragon < input.txt | java Dragon | java Dragon

  public class Dragon  {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      String dragon = StdIn.readString();
      String nogard = StdIn.readString();
      StdOut.print(dragon + "L" + nogard);
      StdOut.print(" ");
      StdOut.print(dragon + "R" + nogard);
      StdOut.println();
    }
  }

A: This program using "re-directions (< or >)" to get its input from a input.txt file.
   The output of the first run of the program is the input for the second one
   This is achieved using "piping (|)".

   Program Trace: Dragon < input.txt
   dragon     nogard     stdout
   F          F          FLF FRF   // this stdout is the stdin for next java Dragon i.e. java Dragon < Dragon < input.txt
   FLF        FRF        FLFLFRF FLFRFRF
   FLFLFRF    FLFRFRF    FLFLFRFLFLFRFRF FLFLFRFRFLFRFRF

1.5.14 Which of the following require saving all the values from standard input (in
an array, say), and which could be implemented as a filter using only a fixed number
of variables? For each, the input comes from standard input and consists of n real
numbers between 0 and 1.
• Print the maximum and minimum numbers.                    // min and max variables are enough
• Print the sum of the squares of the n numbers.            // sum variable is enough
• Print the average of the n numbers.                       // total and count variables are enough
• Print the median of the n numbers.                        // array required, must be sorted and then get median
• Print the percentage of numbers greater than the average. // array required, after we calculate average we must read numbers again
• Print the n numbers in increasing order.                  // array required
• Print the n numbers in random order.                      // array required
