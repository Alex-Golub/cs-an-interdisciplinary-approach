/**
 * 24. Decimal expansion of rational numbers.
 * Given two integers p and q, the decimal expansion of p/q has an infinitely repeating cycle.
 * For example, 1/33 = 0.03030303.... We use the notation 0.(03) to denote that 03 repeats indefinitely.
 * As another example, 8639/70000 = 0.1234(142857).
 * Write a program DecimalExpansion.java that reads in two command line integers p and q and prints
 * the decimal expansion of p/q using the above notation.
 *
 * TODO
