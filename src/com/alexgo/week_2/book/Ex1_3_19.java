/**
 * 1.3.19 Show that program 1.3.6 implements Newton’s method for finding the
 * square root of c.
 *
 * Hint : Use the fact that the slope of the tangent to a (differentiable)
 * function f(x) at x = t is f'(t) to find the equation of the tangent line, and then use
 * that equation to find the point where the tangent line intersects the x-axis to show
 * that you can use Newton’s method to find a root of any function as follows: at each
 * iteration, replace the estimate t by t - f(t) / f'(t).
