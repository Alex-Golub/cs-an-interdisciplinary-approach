/**
 * 1.3.45 Chaos.
 * Write a program to study the following simple model for population growth,
 * which might be applied to study fish in a pond, bacteria in a test tube,
 * or any of a host of similar situations.
 * We suppose that the population ranges from
 * 0 (extinct) to 1 (maximum population that can be sustained).
 * If the population at time t is x, then we suppose the
 * population at time t + 1 to be r(1 - x), where the
 * argument r, known as the fecundity parameter, controls the rate of growth.
 * Start with a small population—say, x = 0.01—and study the result of iterating the model,
 * for various values of r.
 * For which values of r does the population stabilize at
 * x = 1 - 1/r?
 * Can you say anything about the population when r is 3.5? 3.8? 5?
