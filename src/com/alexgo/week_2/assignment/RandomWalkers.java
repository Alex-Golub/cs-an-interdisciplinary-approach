/**
 * 4. Random walkers.
 * Write a program RandomWalkers.java that takes two integer command-line arguments r and trials.
 * In each of trials independent experiments, simulate a random walk until the random walker is at
 * Manhattan distance r from the starting point.
 * Print the average number of steps.
 *
 * As r increases, we expect the random walker to take more and more steps.
 * But how many more steps?
 * Use RandomWalkers.java to formulate a hypothesis as to how the average number of steps grows
 * as a function of r.
 *
 * Estimating an unknown quantity by generating random samples and aggregating the results is
 * an example of Monte Carlo simulationâ€”a powerful computational technique that is used widely
 * in statistical physics, computational finance, and computer graphics.
