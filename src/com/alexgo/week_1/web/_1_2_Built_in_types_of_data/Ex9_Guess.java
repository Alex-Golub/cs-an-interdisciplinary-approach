/**
 * 9. Guess the biggest number.
 *  Consider the following game.
 *  Alice writes down two integers between 0 and 100 on two cards.
 *  Bob gets to select one of the two cards and see its value.
 *  After looking at the value, Bob commits to one of the two cards.
 *  If he chooses a card with the largest value, he wins; otherwise he loses.
 *
 *  Devise a strategy (and corresponding computer program) for Bob so that he guarantees to win
 *  strictly more than half the time.
